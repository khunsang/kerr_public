# kerr_public
Public version of my kerr repository

## How to add to your system's PYTHONPATH
If you have cloned the repository to
 * /Users/home/kerr_public/

Then you will want to add the following line to your ~/.bash_profile (or .bashrc or equivalent)
 * export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/Users/home/kerr_public/
 
You will then want to source the related file
 source ~/.bash_profile
